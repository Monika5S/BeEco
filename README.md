<h1>BeEco</h1>

<h3>“BeEco” is a software based on the idea of preventing the waste of potentially useful recyclable
materials by helping to keep them out of landfills and incinerators. It is a web-based platform
which helps users to identify recyclable waste and they can find the recycling points.</h3>

<br><br>

<h2>PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION</h2>

<h3>Improper disposal of waste has a huge environmental impact and leads to serious problems.
When recyclable items are thrown into the garbage instead of recycling, they end up in landfills
and when these landfills are completely filled, new areas are transformed into new landfills
causing damage to their nearby communities and also helps in reducing the consumption of fresh
raw materials. Sometimes people don't know how they can help reduce landfill overflows in our
ecosystem and prevent the destruction of the environment.</h3>

<br><br>

<h2>PROPOSED SOLUTION</h2>
<h3>Our idea is to provide solution to the communities to reduce the amount of waste they dispose of
and increase awareness of the impact they have on the environment. Our aim is to create a
system where an individual can find recyclable items and send it to the nearest recycle point.</h3>
